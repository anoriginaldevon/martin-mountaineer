        <h3>Planning Assistance</h3>
<p>If you’re fit and skilled, but you haven’t lined up a complex trip before, I can help you plan out all the fiddly details to make sure nothing falls through on your trip. This means flights, busses, hotel stays, currency exchange, route planning, campsites, equipment lists, food and water procurement, etc. Only pay for the assistance you need.</p>
<h3>Do You Have A Vision?</h3>
<p>If you're coming into this with a dream of a certain place, activity, or a line on a map that you want to experience, I can help you make that happen. Maybe you want to paddle through the lakes of the Togiak wilderness or spend the cold dreary winter in sunny Mexico rock climbing and eating tacos. Maybe you have larger goals such as a summit of a particular mountain or you want to make the most out of a season of whitewater. I can help you train, plan, and prepare for these trips.</p>
<p>Do you need help with training, creating an itinerary, lining up logistics, working out kinks in your systems, or all of the above? Do you just need someone to point you in the right direction a few times?</p>
