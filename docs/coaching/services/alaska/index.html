        <h3>Start To End Coaching For A Remote Traverse Of Alaskan Wilderness</h3>
<p>This is the whole enchilada. I recommend you start here if you have limited backcountry experience. I will guide you through the planning, training, and preparation for a one to three week trek across an area of your choosing in Alaska. Though it may sound extreme to some, if you break down this type of trip and plan effectively it can be accessible and realistic for most people.</p>
<h3>Why Alaska?</h3>
<p>Alaska has some of the only truly remote wilderness left in the United States, and is one of the few spots like this across the world. Yet it is contained in a first world country that is relatively safe to travel in. Much of the wilderness is easier to navigate while off trail, has easy water access, and is fairly safe in reguards to flora, fauna, and disease. This is likely the best safety net you can find while still accessing incredible remote terrain complete with beautiful mountains, glaciers, rivers, tundra, and wildlife.</p>
<h3>What to Expect</h3>
<p>Trekking in remote Alaska is not easy. You will need to cross terrain ranging from boulder fields, tussock bogs, dense brush, snow, and cross rivers and streams. Weather is variable and depending on the region you may experience temperatures ranging from 30F to 100F in the summer. 80 degree swings of temperature can happen over a matter of hours. All of this with a heavy backpack in the 50-60lb range. Hopefully this sounds like a fun challenge to you ;)</p>
<p>You will need to have a few multi-day backpacking trips under your belt by the time you embark on the expedition and time on terrain similar to what you'll encounter with your expedition load in your pack. You'll feel good if you can run an 8 minute mile. Better is better.</p>
<p>Wildlife is beautiful but it can be dangerous. I reccomend packing bearspray and storing food in hard sided bear canisters or the highest end Ursacks. Even moose and musk ox can be dangerous if you get too close, but if you respect the wildlife and give them space and alert them of your pressence, you are unlikely to encounter any trouble. Life is hard in the tundra and any animal living there would rather have an easy day and stay away from you than risk a fight where they could be injured.</p>
<p>This is true remote wilderness. Even a twisted ankle or knee can become a big problem in some of these Areas. Rescue might take hours, days, or longer before they can get to you. This is why you need to prepare well and ensure you are confident trekking and navigating through rugged terrain. Options range from trips where you are within a few days walking distance from a highway on the entire duration to remote areas hundreds of miles from a village that would have to send a bush plane to rescue you.</p>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<p>Food and travel can be vary variable depending on the region you are traveling to and where you are coming from. Expect round trip flights to Anchorage to range from $500 to $1000 USD if you are traveling from the United States. If you are traveling to bush territory you will need to add another $1000-$2000 for the bush plane. Food will generally range from $80 to $500 USD depending on the length of trip and what you want to be eating.</p>
