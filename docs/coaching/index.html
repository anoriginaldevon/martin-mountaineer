    <h3>Coaching and Trip Planning for Backcountry Adventures</h3>
    <p>This is for people who want to see mystical lands, build incredible friendships, and find strength in themselves but don't know where to start.
      I can coach you through the entire process of a backcountry expedition: developing a vision, planning logistics, building a team, developing skills, 
      and training your body. But embarking on the quest is up to you.
    </p>
    
    <p>This is NOT another guide service or leadership program. They will drag you accross a schedule until you're hungry enough to eat their canned program. 
      I will coach you through the complexities of backcountry expeditions until you 
      are capable of taking care of yourself. This is what real adventure and leadership is. I will not be there to hold your hand. It is up to you to rise to the occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expect this to be a richer experience that will teach you more and cost you less money, but understand that it is costing you less money because 
      it will cost you more effort. This is the option in between guide services and being a maverick and figuring things out as you go.
      I chose the maverick route when I got into rock climbing and had a number of close calls with death. I don't recommend this. It's stupid.
    </p>
    <h3>Minors, Students, and Gap-Years</h3>
    <p>
      If you are looking for a remote wilderness experience and want the challenge of leading yourself rather than 
      being stuck in a guided program, I can help you build an expedition for your summer away from school or a gap year after schooling. 
      These types of trips will give you invaluable life skills that can only be won the hard way. 
      Parents are welcome and encouraged to join during coaching sessions.
    </p>
    <h3>Options</h3>
   
    <h4>Start To Finish Coaching For Trekking In Alaska</h4>
    <h4>Trip Planning Assistance</h4>
    <h4>Custom Trips and Coaching</h4>
    
    <p>
      These all happen in virtual meetings so that you can easily take these around your personal schedule and 
      spend more of your time focusing on training and preparing for your expedition. I will draw plans prior to meetings, then during a session we will go over the goals that were set last 
      meeting and set new goals for the next. The only things we go over are things you need help with. If you just need help lining up logistics, 
      I won't bogg you down with training advice and vice versa.     
    </p> 
    <h3>Rate</h3>
    <p>
      The current rate for my time is $100 USD per hour. Both the coaching sessions as well as the time I spend planning logistics before sessions will be logged and billed hourly.
I offer a discounted rate of $80 USD per hour for minor, student, and gap year adventurers. 
      Most services should not take much more than a few hours of my time per month.
    </p>
    <h3>First Hour Long Informational Session Is Free</h3>
