        <p>
          It's easy to look like an expert. Any idiot can blab on about their accolades. It only takes a few emails to end up speaking at a school or company
           and maybe a week of evening work to write an article for a magazine. This about page is not for that nonsense. This is to show you who I really am
            and be my honest self.

          I like clouds and tree bark. I like photography. I like playing music, but I never do enough of it. I play the guitar and the harmonica, and I think the blues is super fun to play. I'm getting into hunitng
           and fishing with the goal of working this into my expeditions. I'm eager to learn about subsistence living from the land. It's my opinion that 
           this is the best way for us to bring more meaning, joy, and riches into our lives. I aim to make this my life's work.

          Come back for the occasional trip report to learn more about me and the things I do!
