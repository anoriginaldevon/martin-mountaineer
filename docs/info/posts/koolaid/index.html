        <h3>What Is The Koolaid?</h3>
<p>On November 18th, 1978 a cult leader by the name of Jim Jones convinced 918 of his followers to drink a poisoned grape flavored drink resulting in their deaths. This was not the first nor will it be the last time that twisted deluded morons force their bullshit down people’s throats. It’s happening now everywhere. Buy this. Be this. Do this. Even the place where we were supposed to be free from the propaganda of the machine has become polluted by its greed. Freedom of the hills. This used to be the attitude of the backcountry explorer. You went into the mountains, the ocean, the forests because no one was there to tell you what to do except for Mother Nature. A simple clean existence. Now our national parks have become commercialized backdrops for instagram photos, our craftsmen have become product salesmen pushing the latest and lightest equipment, our adventure acquired at the tap of a finger on a screen. This is the Koolaid.</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Quit it. Don’t listen to the media’s lies and turn your desire away from their industrial garbage. The only thing worth living for is people. It’s easy to forget it. Live and learn to live better. Go into the wild and let the forests and mountains and wind and water teach you what you don’t know. Find what’s caged inside you and let it free.</p>
